            <h2>Career of Choice Research Essay</h2>
            <div class="half-split">
                <p>The Career of Choice Research Essay was a research writing assignment to gather information on the career I am most interested in pursuing. I chose to write about the career of a computer programmer because it is something I am passionate about. The purpose of the writing was to learn more about what I wanted to do in my future. Points researched include, career duties, work environment, education requirements, and salaries. Researching about the educational and experience requirements for becoming a computer programmer was a great help in understanding the steps I need to take to reach my goals. I chose to share this sample of writing because it shows my ability to research and write about a given topic.
