                    <p>This project was made between two people, my friend and I, to create a digital web based version of the board game Splendor. Splendor is a 2-4 player game where each player takes a turn collecting gems from five different colors to buy cards to earn more gems and points. We chose to recreate Splendor because it is a board game that we both enjoyed. This was a great project for developing skills on JavaScript objects and classes as they were heavily used for the creation of the game. As a learning experience the project game with its challenges related to GitHub merges that we overcame with persistence and communication between the two of us. During the development of this project we faced many merging issues that we took the time to investigate and clear before merging our individual progress together.</p>

                    <p>The EECU Calculator was created to put new JavaScript skills into practice in the form of a budgeting calculator. The list of jobs and incomes were provided by the credit union EECU. The website is a digital version of an EECU pamphlet used for teaching monthly deductions from a paycheck and how to balance a checkbook. The challenges faced were due to my inexperience in JavaScript at the time but were quickly resolved as worked through the project. I persevered through learning JavaScript to create a final product that I was successful in creating.</p>

                    <p>This informational website created with the goal to spread awareness about social engineering attacks and to help people understand how to stay protected against them. The twist with the project was that I was not able to code any of it myself. During the project every person would get a new partner every 30 minutes to work with. In those 30 minutes you would either work for someone else or have someone else work for you. This project greatly improved my collaboration and communication skills as I had to be clear in my directions for my partner to understand what I wanted to be done. My planning was a great help to the success of my communication, before any work with other people I made a clear design using Figma to help with giving my partner an idea of how I wanted the final product to look.</p>

                    <p>This layout practice project is a sample project showcasing the ability to create a responsive website layout using CSS and following the needs of an employer. During the process of the project I learned how to better use media queries to create a responsive layout across all screen sizes. A challenge faced was making sure that the layout remained consistent when resizing for screens. Creating this website showed investigation skills in creating a near replica of the given image. The skills learned about responsive design are important for the field of web development.</p>
