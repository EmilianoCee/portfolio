            <h2>League of Legends Challenge Tracker</h2>
            <div class="half-split">
                <p>At the start of my programming journey I decided to combine my interest in video games with programming to apply my skills to something I enjoyed. In order to learn JavaScript I created a website to track my progress in a League of Legends that involves winning a game with every playable character. It has an image of every character that could be toggled to show which have been completed, there are also ways to sort through the characters to make things easier to find. This website is a tool that helped organize and track my progress while applying my new knowledge with JavaScript. It was a great experience creating something that my friends and I all used when it was completed. I chose to share this project because it shows my passion and applications for programming what I enjoy and what could help others. As this project was my first step into JavaScript, displaying it also shows my growth in programming.

            <h2>Wave Conversion with TI Calculator</h2>
            <div class="half-split">
                <p>Using my TI calculator I created a program to convert between wave frequency, wavelength, and energy using TI-BASIC. In my physics class there was a lot of work that required conversion between different wave measurements. It was a simple concept but it began to become repetitive to switch between measurements. With my interest in programming I decided to create a program on my calculator to convert the measurements for me. I am showing this project because it shows my ability to program to improve efficiency in my work. </p>
